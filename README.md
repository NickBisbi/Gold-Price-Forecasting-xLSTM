# Gold-Price-Forecasting-xLSTM
My Master's Thesis project at the University of Thessaly. The project focuses on predicting the price of Gold using macroeconomic indicators. It leverages state-of-the-art Deep Learning architectures, specifically the xLSTM (Extended LSTM), and evaluates their performance against traditional Standard LSTMs and classical statistical methods.
